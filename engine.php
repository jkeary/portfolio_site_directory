        <p class="li_lead">During the spring of 2013, I took a Masters course in Game Audio taught by Composer, Producer and Game Sound Designer Jean Luc Cohen.  This course was a facinating look into the world of game audio, which leads the industry into new audio based technologies.  This is a project from that class in which I created the sounds of a car engine through physical modeling and procedural audio.  I used the graphical programming language Pure Data to patch this incredibly complex model of a 4 cylindar engine together.  Procedural audio such as this is the future of game sound design.</p>
