      <p class="li_lead">My final project for my Audio for Video class, Spring 2013, NYU MTech, was to completely redo all aspects of the soundtrack of the Pixar short, Presto.  The project covered all facets of audio for film.  For the musical soundtrack, I felt the music needed to be fully orchestrated in the tradition of Disney and Pixar.  Since I did not have a full orchestra at my disposal, this involved piecing together classical music pieces and adding my own music when the story needed it.  That part of the project was done in Logic Pro.  The sound effects were collected from different sound libraries, Foley work (making and recording our own sound effects), and voice over work (I even did the voice over for the magician character).  The project was mixed and edited in Pro Tools in both Stereo and 5.0 surround.</p>
